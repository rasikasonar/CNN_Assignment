# Project Name
> Build a CNN machine learning model that will analyse bunch of images of human skin (2239 to be precise) 
and detect detect melanoma (skin cancer). The model builds a CNN model using convolution layer to calculate
The accuracy of training data and validation dataset.

## General Information
- Build a CNN based machine learning model to read images and detect melanoma (type of skin cancer)
- CNN based architecture by using dropout and augmentation strategies

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- The model accuracy for training data set after building with the help of augmentation and class imbalancing
is coming as 90% and for validation dataset is coming as 83%

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Technologies Used
- Tensorflow, conV2D, Augmenter, Dropout, python, matplotlib, keras
